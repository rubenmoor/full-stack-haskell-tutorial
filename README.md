# full-stack-haskell-tutorial
from zero to hero: install an operating system and hack on a haskell web app

# The operating system

## Pick one

I choose [NixOS](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#ch-installation).

## Prepare bootable usb installation medium

...

## Reboot into installation medium

Follow the NixOS installation guide.

Definitely run `nixos-generate-config` to get the hardware specific configuration.

Overwrite `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix` now or later with your own file, based on your preferences.

### NixOS configuration

#### Terminal

E.g. rxvt_unicode with proper ".Xdefaults"

#### Shell

E.g. zsh with oh-my-zsh

#### VIM

Better get a nice vim configuration as soon as possible.

Don't know vim yet? 

Read about it [here](https://danielmiessler.com/study/vim/).

Or the old-fashioned way: open a terminal, type "vim" and ":help".
